Piperka-Fox is a Firefox addon that integrates the [Piperka][piperka] webcomic
bookmarking service into the browser. It displays your comics list in a sidebar
including the number of unread pages in each comic. Clicking a comic opens it 
in the current tab and Piperka-Fox starts following page navigation. When you
leave the comic's site Piperka-Fox will update the bookmark in Piperka to the
last page you read.

Piperka-Fox is currently in early development, so not much works yet.
